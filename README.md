# Antra_React_20230501_Evaluation
The project is pushed after 5pm because my computer had some issues on git remote push, 
I tried for about 40mins to fix it and by the time it finally worked it was already 5pm,
but the project's functions were done around 4 pm, i didn't expect to have troubles with
github though. I apologize for the confusion I caused regarding my submission time
